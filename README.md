Ruby on Rails Web application to enable payments for Tax Tribunal fees.

## Setup & Run (locally)

This app uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run locally, which lets you spin up an app container and a database with minimal effort:

```
# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Create the database
docker-compose run web rails db:create db:migrate

# Run the containers
docker-compose up
```

### GOV.UK Pay API Key

In order to use GOV.UK Pay, you will need to configure your environment with a sandbox API key â€“ this can be obtained from the [GOV.UK Pay Self Service](https://selfservice.pymnt.uk/) portal (although you will need an account for this), and then set as `GOVUK_PAY_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.

### Running the app directly on your machine

You are of course free to run the app directly too, in which case you will need to bring your own Ruby-ready environment and PostgreSQL server. You will also need to tweak the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in `.env`.

### Nokogiri installation issues on OSX

If you are trying to run the app directly on OSX 10.11 and nokogiri
1.6.8 will not install, run `xcode-select --install` and try again. The
issue is described [here][1].
